# Bulk Obsidian Operations 

This repo contains a collection of scripts that help manage an obsidian 
collection. Obsidian stores notes in a collection of markdown scripts - the 
tools in this repo help standardize and format those scripts. 

> Note: There are some functionalities that are not completed yet. Renaming does not 
> update the internal file links at this time. Might in the future, will update if it changes. 

### Tools: 

- `rename.sh` allows files that are generated without a timestamp to be 
renamed to include the timestamp as the filename prefix.
